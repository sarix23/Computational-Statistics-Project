## Spotify Recommendation System - Simple Version
### Spotify
Spotify is a music streaming service 🎧 available through the app and website, providing access to millions of songs 🎼, podcasts 🎤, and videos 🎬 from artists around the world 🌍. One of its powerful features is the recommendation system: based on user listening habits and preferences🙋🏽‍♀️, it personalizes the user's experience by introducing them to new songs and content that might interest them 🤩 every day.
### Project Objectives
The goal 🎯 of this project is to attempt to estimate, based on the knowledge acquired so far in the course, a model capable of classifying the songs offered by the platform into two classes (Dislike👎🏻, Like👍🏻) based on user preferences, to predict 🧞‍♂️ which music content might be of interest to them.
### Dataset Description
The dataset was constructed by querying the official Spotify API (🔗: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) by a user, who selected 13 KPIs (quantitative and qualitative variables) for 195 songs of their choice. These songs were then classified into the "Dislike" and "Like" classes based on the user's musical preferences.
